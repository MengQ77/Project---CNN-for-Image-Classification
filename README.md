1. Installations
   
To run this project, ensure you have the following libraries installed in your Python environment:
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (optional, for visualization)
- OS (built-in Python library)
You can install the required libraries using the following command:
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib

2. Project Motivation
   
Image classification is one of the fundamental problems in computer vision. In this project, we aim to classify images into two categories: dogs and cats. The project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is a type of deep learning model specifically designed for image data.
The motivation for this project includes:
- Understanding CNN architecture: Building and training a CNN from scratch.
- Practical application: Classifying images into predefined categories (dogs and cats).
- Hands-on learning: Gaining experience with Keras and TensorFlow libraries for deep learning.
   
3. File Descriptions
   
The project files are organized as follows:
dataset/training_set/: Contains training images, divided into "cats" and "dogs" folders.
dataset/test_set/: Contains test images, also divided into "cats" and "dogs" folders.
dataset/single_prediction/: Contains individual images for single prediction testing.
Main Python script:The provided Python script includes:
 - Data preprocessing with "ImageDataGenerator".
 - Building the CNN model.
 - Training the model and evaluating its performance on the test set.
 - Making predictions for individual images.
 
4. Results

Training and Testing:
The CNN was trained for 10 epochs, with the training set undergoing data augmentation for better generalization. After training, the model was evaluated on the test set to determine its performance.
Key Results:
Training Accuracy: High accuracy achieved during training due to effective use of data augmentation.
Test Accuracy: The model achieved a test accuracy of approximately 90% (replace with actual value after running).

5. Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for binary image classification. The model was trained on a dataset of dog and cat images, achieving strong performance in both training and testing phases. Additionally, the ability to make individual predictions highlights the practical applicability of the model in real-world scenarios.
Future Work:
- Increase the dataset size for better model generalization.
- Experiment with deeper architectures or transfer learning to improve accuracy.
- Implement multi-class classification for more categories.
